# Eponym

Eponym is a node script capable of generating a list of words that are currently available NPM packages. The list of words is pulled from the wonderful [WebstersEnglishDictionary](https://github.com/matthewreagan/WebstersEnglishDictionary).

> **eponym**: _noun_, a person after who a discovery, invention or place is named

Check the `out/` directory for the list of names from the last time it was run.

## Getting started

```
git clone https://github.com/zposten/eponym.git
cd eponym
yarn

# Grab 20 random words from the dictionary and return the ones
# that are available as packages on NPM
yarn start -l 20
```
